Development Guidelines
Branching Strategy
We follow a simple branching strategy:

trunk: The main branch containing stable and production-ready code.
branches: For new features or bug fixes. Once completed and tested, merge back into trunk.
Coding Standards
To maintain code quality, adhere to our coding standards:

Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
Write meaningful variable and function names.
Include comments and documentation where necessary.
Testing
Testing is crucial for ensuring code quality. When adding new features or fixing bugs:

Write unit tests for any new functionality.
Run existing tests to ensure nothing is broken.
Use our testing framework specified in docs/TESTING.md.
