## Getting Started

To contribute to this project, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Subversion (SVN)**: We use SVN for version control. Familiarize yourself with SVN commands.
- **Programming Languages**: Know the languages and frameworks our project uses (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Project Goals**: Understand our mission and the problem we are solving.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) while interacting with the community.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please report it:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If not, create a new issue in the issue tracker with the following details:
   - A clear title.
   - A detailed description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable).
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs.

### Submitting Code

To submit code changes:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/add-payment-processing`).
   - Command: `svn copy trunk/branches/your-branch-name`

2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix.

3. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Command: `svn commit -m "Brief description of changes"`

4. **Submit a Merge Request**:
   - Notify the team about your changes via an issue or a message in our communication channel.

### Documentation

Contributions to documentation are just as valuable as code. If you notice areas that need clarification or improvement, please:

1. Edit the relevant documentation files in the `docs` directory.
2. Follow the documentation style guide provided in the `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
3. Submit your changes following the same process as code submissions.

## Development Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

We follow a simple branching strategy:

- **`trunk`**: The main branch containing stable and production-ready code.
- **`branches`**: For new features or bug fixes. Once completed and tested, merge back into `trunk`.

### Coding Standards

To maintain code quality, adhere to our coding standards:

- Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Write meaningful variable and function names.
- Include comments and documentation where necessary.

### Testing

Testing is crucial for ensuring code quality. When adding new features or fixing bugs:

- Write unit tests for any new functionality.
- Run existing tests to ensure nothing is broken.
- Use our testing framework specified in `docs/TESTING.md`.
