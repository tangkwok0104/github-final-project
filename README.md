# GitHub Final Project: Simple Interest Calculator

## Project Overview

This project is a calculator that computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Input

- **p**: Principal amount
- **t**: Time period in years
- **r**: Annual rate of interest (as a percentage)

## Output

- **Simple Interest**: Calculated using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{p \times r \times t}{100}
  \]

## Usage

1. **Input the values** for principal, time period, and annual rate of interest.
2. **Calculate** the simple interest using the formula provided.
3. **Output** the calculated simple interest.

## Example

For example, if:
- Principal (p) = 1000
- Time (t) = 3 years
- Rate (r) = 5%

The output will be:
Simple Interest = 1000 * 5 * 3 / 100 = 150

## Conclusion

This simple interest calculator is a straightforward tool that allows users to easily compute the interest on a given principal amount over a specified time period at a given interest rate.
